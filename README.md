# My Resume
Daniel Nieto's resume in Markdown, ready to be exported to PDF format.

## Export it to PDF

You need to install `markdown-pdf`, open up a console a type in (you need [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) of course):

1. `sudo npm install markdown-pdf -g`
2. after installation, you just have to go to where `resume.md` is located and type in this command:

	`markdown-pdf resume.md`

It will create a `resume.pdf` file within the same directory with the rendered Markdown.
