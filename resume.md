## SUMMARY

I've been involved in technology since I can recall, I've done all kinds of computer stuff ranging from programming low level hardware-software interfaces to animating 3D models, but my true love and strength is to code (any kind of coding really) my passion is software, I like to create videogames, I like to create modern websites, I like to create desktop apps, I like to create mobile apps. I like to create.

## EXPERIENCE

- ### Envato (Placeit.net)
	*05/2018 - Present*

	__Frontend Developer__

	I'm a developer building many of the most recent features of Placeit. Altough I'm mainly a front-end engineer, I have done backend work as well using NodeJS, here is a list of some of the features that I have worked on:
	- __Redesign of the homepage__
  	- __Lists components:__ I created the component that shows stacked images/videos and allows the user to swipe/scroll through them, this component is found on the Homepage and on all results pages.
  	- __Video pages:__ I built the UI and all the business logic to allow users to add slides to their video stages, let them sort (drag and drop), duplicate and delete them. Also play the videos on mouse hover, show progress on the playback, update the previews when the video is processed, and persist video previews across browser history changes.
  	- __Audios Waveform (MP3 to SVG):__ I created the node module that Placeit uses to read a MP3 file, decodes its PCM data and then generates an SVG file with the waves from the audio in the form of bars, this SVG file then gets uploaded to Amazon S3 and is used across Video stage pages.
  	- __Audio Player widgets:__ I created the Audio Player widgets that are found on the Video pages and on the Audio Library. These Audio players allow lazy .mp3 loading upon playing, and seek-and-play, also, the player displays the playback progress using the SVG files that my node module creates.
  	- __User uploads / Cropper server:__ I created the Node server (using Express) that accepts user uploaded images to use within our stages. This server's responsibility is to accept user content and/or reposition (crop, zoom in/out) the media upon user request, then uploads the result to Amazon S3, to be served on the frontend.

	[Placeit.net](https://www.placeit.net) is a company that was recently acquired by [Envato](https://envato.com/)
