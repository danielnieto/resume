## SUMMARY

I've been involved in technology since I can recall, I've done all kinds of computer stuff ranging from programming low level hardware-software interfaces to animating 3D models, but my true love and strength is to code (any kind of coding really) my passion is software, I like to create videogames, I like to create modern websites, I like to create desktop apps, I like to create mobile apps. I like to create.
